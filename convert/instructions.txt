1. on replit, run convert_index.py
    a. this converts the indexes of some mappings (loans, balances) to be indexed by discord id rather than nation id
2. on replit, run convert_dict.py
    a. this stores the contents of the database as a dict in a .txt format, in a file named dict.txt
    b. this is required as trying to download the pickled file, the current db format, would not work
3. download dict.txt
4. now, on a non replit copy, run convert_database.py
    a. this actually converts the dict.txt to a format that the current version uses
5. done! can now run this version, with all data migrated from previous
